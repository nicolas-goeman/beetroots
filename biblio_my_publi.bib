  abstract = {This work considers a challenging radio-astronomy inverse problem of physical parameter inference from multispectral observations. The forward model underlying this problem is a computationally expensive numerical simulation. In addition, the observation model mixes different sources of noise yielding a non-concave log-likelihood function. To overcome these issues, we introduce a likelihood approximation with controlled error. Given the absence of ground truth, parameter inference is conducted with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to provide credibility intervals along with point estimates. To this aim, we propose a new sampler that addresses the numerical challenges induced by the observation model, in particular the non-log-concavity of the posterior distribution. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated on synthetic yet realistic astrophysical data. We believe that the proposed approach is very general and can be adapted to many similar difficult inverse problems.},

  abstract = {Methods. These emulators are defined with artificial neural networks (ANNs) with adapted architectures and are fitted using regression strategies instead of interpolation methods. The specificities inherent in ISM models need to be addressed to design and train adequate ANNs. Indeed, such models often predict numerous observables (e.g., line intensities) from just a few input physical parameters and can yield outliers due to numerical instabilities or physical bistabilities and multistabilities. We propose applying five strategies to address these characteristics: 1) an outlier removal procedure; 2) a clustering method that yields homogeneous subsets of lines that are simpler to predict with different ANNs; 3) a dimension reduction technique that enables us to adequately size the network architecture; 4) the physical inputs are augmented with a polynomial transform to ease the learning of nonlinearities; and 5) a dense architecture to ease the learning of simpler relations between line intensities and physical parameters. Results. We compare the proposed ANNs with four standard classes of interpolation methods, nearest-neighbor, linear, spline, and radial basis function (RBF), to emulate a representative ISM numerical model known as the Meudon PDR code. Combinations of the proposed strategies produce networks that outperform all interpolation methods in terms of accuracy by a factor of 2 in terms of the average error (reaching 4.5\% on the Meudon PDR code) and a factor of 3 for the worst-case errors (33\%). These networks are also 1 000 times faster than accurate interpolation methods and require ten to forty times less memory. Conclusions. This work will enable efficient inferences on wide-field multiline observations of the ISM.},
